A crate defining the client API contract for the Unity Catalog Delta Tables API.

It has no network dependencies, so any transport can implement it. The REST implementation lives in
[`unity-catalog-delta-rest-client`], and [`delta-kernel-unity-catalog`] depends on this crate rather
than on a concrete client.

It provides:

- `UpdateTableClient`: the trait for committing a new version to a UC-managed table, which
  `delta-kernel-unity-catalog`'s `UCCommitter` dispatches through.
- Serde wire models for the UC Delta Tables endpoints: `load_table`, credential vending, `/config`,
  table and staging-table creation, `update_table`, and metrics reporting.

Only `update_table` (the commit RPC) sits behind a trait. Read and credential-vending flows are
connector-driven: connectors call concrete client methods, or bring their own HTTP plumbing, then
hand the responses to `delta-kernel-unity-catalog` helpers.
