# Implementing the Engine trait

The `Engine` trait is the main integration point between your connector and Delta Kernel. For
background on what the Engine trait is and when you need a custom one, see the
[Connector Overview](./overview.md) and [The Engine Trait](../concepts/engine_trait.md).

## The Engine trait

The `Engine` trait has four required methods, each returning a handler:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Engine {
    fn evaluation_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn EvaluationHandler>;
    fn storage_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn StorageHandler>;
    fn json_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn JsonHandler>;
    fn parquet_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn ParquetHandler>;
}
```

You don't have to implement all four handlers from scratch. A common approach is to start
with `DefaultEngine` and selectively replace handlers. For example, you might provide a
custom `ParquetHandler` that reads into your engine's native columnar format while reusing
the default handlers for everything else.

Many of the `Engine` handlers take or return `EngineData`. See [EngineData](engine_data.md) for more
information about this type.

## StorageHandler

`StorageHandler` provides file system operations. The kernel calls this to list and read
files (as bytes) from storage.

```rust,ignore
pub trait StorageHandler {
    fn list_from(&self, path: &Url)
        -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn Iterator<Item = DeltaResult<FileMeta>>>>;

    fn read_files(&self, files: Vec<FileSlice>)
        -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn Iterator<Item = DeltaResult<Bytes>>>>;

    fn copy_atomic(&self, src: &Url, dest: &Url) -> DeltaResult<()>;

    fn put(&self, path: &Url, data: Bytes, overwrite: bool) -> DeltaResult<()>;

    fn head(&self, path: &Url) -> DeltaResult<FileMeta>;
}
```

### Key contracts

- **`list_from`**: Results must be sorted lexicographically by path. If the path ends with
  `/`, list all files in that directory. Otherwise, list files lexicographically greater than
  the given path in the same directory.

- **`copy_atomic`**: Must fail with `Error::FileAlreadyExists` if the destination exists.
  This is used for commit publishing in catalog-managed tables.

- **`put`**: Writes raw bytes to the given path. If `overwrite` is false and the file already
  exists, must fail with `Error::FileAlreadyExists`.

- **`head`**: Must return `Error::FileNotFound` if the file doesn't exist.

- **`read_files`**: Each `FileSlice` is a `(Url, Option<Range<u64>>)`. When the range is
  `None`, read the entire file.

### Default implementation

The `DefaultEngine` uses [`object_store`](https://docs.rs/object_store) for storage, which supports
local filesystem, S3, GCS, and Azure out of the box.

## JsonHandler

`JsonHandler` reads and writes JSON. The kernel uses this for Delta log commits
(`_delta_log/*.json`) and checkpoint sidecars.

```rust,ignore
pub trait JsonHandler {
    fn parse_json(
        &self,
        json_strings: Box<dyn EngineData>,
        output_schema: SchemaRef,
    ) -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn EngineData>>;

    fn read_json_files(
        &self,
        files: &[FileMeta],
        physical_schema: SchemaRef,
        predicate: Option<PredicateRef>,
    ) -> DeltaResult<FileDataReadResultIterator>;

    fn write_json_file(
        &self,
        path: &Url,
        data: DeltaResultIterator<'_, FilteredEngineData>,
        overwrite: bool,
    ) -> DeltaResult<FileSize>;
}
```

### Key contracts

- **`parse_json`**: Input is a single-column batch of strings (JSON objects). Output
  columns match the `output_schema`. Missing fields should produce nulls for nullable columns.

- **`read_json_files`**: Data must be returned in file order (same order as the `files` slice
  argument), and rows within a file must be in source order. The predicate is an optional hint that
  the engine may ignore. If applied, evaluate exact row values conservatively; unsupported
  expressions and missing references remain unknown.

- **`write_json_file`**: Must write newline-delimited JSON (one JSON object per line). Null
  columns should be omitted from the output to save space. The write must be atomic. If
  `overwrite` is false and the file exists, fail with an error. On success, return the exact
  number of serialized bytes written to the file.

### Default implementation

The `DefaultEngine` uses `arrow_json` for parsing and the `object_store` crate for I/O.

## ParquetHandler

`ParquetHandler` reads and writes Parquet files. This is typically the most important
handler to customize, since it's on the critical path for data reading performance.

```rust,ignore
pub trait ParquetHandler {
    fn read_parquet_files(
        &self,
        files: &[FileMeta],
        physical_schema: SchemaRef,
        predicate: Option<PredicateRef>,
    ) -> DeltaResult<FileDataReadResultIterator>;

    fn write_parquet_file(
        &self,
        location: Url,
        data: DeltaResultIteratorStatic<Box<dyn EngineData>>,
    ) -> DeltaResult<()>;

    fn read_parquet_footer(&self, file: &FileMeta) -> DeltaResult<ParquetFooter>;
}
```

### Key contracts for `read_parquet_files`

**Column resolution**: When reading, the handler must resolve columns from the Parquet file
to the `physical_schema`:

1. If a `StructField` in the schema has a field ID (via `ColumnMetadataKey::ParquetFieldId`
   metadata), match by field ID first.
2. Otherwise, fall back to matching by column name.
3. If no match is found: return nulls for nullable columns, or an error for non-nullable
   columns.

**Column Ordering**: Columns must be returned in the order specified in the `physical_schema`
argument, which is _not_ necessarily the order they may be specified in the parquet file itself.

**Missing Columns**: If a column is specified in the schema, and is nullable, the parquet reader
must return a column of all nulls.

**Ordering**: Like `JsonHandler`, data must be returned in file order, and rows within a
file must be in source order.

**Predicate hint**: If applied, the complete predicate may discard data only when conservative
evaluation proves it cannot match. Footer min/max may be cast only when the cast preserves their
bounds; unsupported expressions and missing references remain unknown.

**Metadata columns**: The handler must support two virtual metadata columns that are not
stored in the Parquet file but generated at read time:

| Metadata column | How to detect | Type | Values |
|-----------------|---------------|------|--------|
| Row index | `StructField` created with `MetadataColumnSpec::RowIndex` | `LONG`, non-nullable | Sequential 0-based position within the file |
| File name | `StructField` has reserved field ID `2147483646` | `STRING`, non-nullable | Full file path/URL |

**Footer reading**: `read_parquet_footer` reads only the Parquet metadata (no data). If the
file has field IDs (column mapping), they must be preserved in the returned schema's
`StructField` metadata under the `ParquetFieldId` key.

### Default implementation

The `DefaultEngine` uses the Apache Arrow Parquet reader/writer with support for column
projection, predicate pushdown, metadata columns, and field-ID-based column matching.

## Cancellation-aware reads

When a caller attaches a `CancellationToken` to a scan (see
[Cancelling a scan](../reading/scan_metadata.md#cancelling-a-scan)), Kernel threads it down to the
`JsonHandler` and `ParquetHandler` reads through three optional methods:

```rust,ignore
fn read_json_files_with_cancellation(
    &self,
    files: &[FileMeta],
    physical_schema: SchemaRef,
    predicate: Option<PredicateRef>,
    cancellation_token: Option<CancellationTokenRef>,
) -> DeltaResult<FileDataReadResultIterator>;

fn read_parquet_files_with_cancellation(/* same shape as above */) -> DeltaResult<FileDataReadResultIterator>;

fn read_parquet_footer_with_cancellation(
    &self,
    file: &FileMeta,
    cancellation_token: Option<CancellationTokenRef>,
) -> DeltaResult<ParquetFooter>;
```

You do not have to implement these. Each has a default that returns `Error::Cancelled` if the
token is already cancelled and otherwise delegates to its plain counterpart. So an engine that
never overrides them still reads correctly and still stops between batches (Kernel polls the token
at every action-batch boundary on its own) — it just won't interrupt a read that is already in
flight.

Override them when a single file read can block long enough that waiting for it defeats the point
of cancelling — a large checkpoint over slow storage, say. The `DefaultEngine` does this by racing
each read against the token:

```rust,ignore
fn read_parquet_files_with_cancellation(
    &self,
    files: &[FileMeta],
    physical_schema: SchemaRef,
    predicate: Option<PredicateRef>,
    cancellation_token: Option<CancellationTokenRef>,
) -> DeltaResult<FileDataReadResultIterator> {
    // Kick off the async read as usual, then poll the read future and the token's
    // `cancelled_future()` together. If cancellation wins the race, drop the in-flight
    // work and yield `Err(Error::Cancelled)` as the iterator's terminal item.
}
```

### The contract you must uphold

- **Surface cancellation as `Error::Cancelled`, never as a short read.** A cancelled read must not
  return fewer rows, an empty iterator, or a bare `None` — anything Kernel could mistake for a
  complete result. Emit `Error::Cancelled` as the terminal item so a partial log replay can never
  look like a finished one.
- **Kernel already handles the pre-read check.** The default bodies fail fast on an
  already-cancelled token before delegating, so an override can skip that and focus on interrupting
  I/O once it has started.

### The CancellationToken trait

The token a caller supplies implements this trait:

```rust,ignore
pub trait CancellationToken: Send + Sync {
    fn is_cancelled(&self) -> bool;
    fn cancelled_future(&self) -> CancelledFuture<'_>;
}
```

Kernel and your engine only *consume* a token; the caller creates and fires it. `is_cancelled` is
the cheap synchronous poll Kernel uses between batches. `cancelled_future` returns a future that
resolves once the token fires — this is what an async engine selects against to wake a read that is
blocked in I/O. Back it with your runtime's own notification primitive (for example, wrapping
`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`); it cannot be synthesized from `is_cancelled` alone without
busy-polling.

## EvaluationHandler

`EvaluationHandler` creates reusable evaluators for expressions and predicates. The kernel
uses this for data skipping (evaluating predicates against file statistics) and for per-file
transformations (partition value injection, row tracking).

```rust,ignore
pub trait EvaluationHandler {
    fn new_expression_evaluator(
        &self,
        input_schema: SchemaRef,
        expression: ExpressionRef,
        output_type: DataType,
    ) -> DeltaResult<Arc<dyn ExpressionEvaluator>>;

    fn new_predicate_evaluator(
        &self,
        input_schema: SchemaRef,
        predicate: PredicateRef,
    ) -> DeltaResult<Arc<dyn PredicateEvaluator>>;

    fn null_row(&self, output_schema: SchemaRef)
        -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn EngineData>>;

    fn create_many(
        &self,
        schema: SchemaRef,
        rows: &[&[Scalar]],
    ) -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn EngineData>>;
}
```

The returned evaluators are reusable objects. The kernel creates them once and calls
`evaluate()` on multiple batches:

```rust,ignore
pub trait ExpressionEvaluator {
    fn evaluate(&self, batch: &dyn EngineData) -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn EngineData>>;
}

pub trait PredicateEvaluator {
    fn evaluate(&self, batch: &dyn EngineData) -> DeltaResult<Box<dyn EngineData>>;
}
```

### Key contracts

- **Expression evaluators** produce one output row per input row. If `output_type` is a
  struct, its fields describe the output columns. Otherwise, the output is a single column.

- **Predicate evaluators** produce a single nullable boolean column. `true` means the row
  matches, `false` or `null` means it doesn't.

- **`null_row`** creates a single-row `EngineData` with all null values. The kernel uses
  this internally for partition column construction.

- **`create_many`** creates a multi-row `EngineData` by applying the given schema to
  multiple rows of `Scalar` values. Each element in `rows` contains one scalar per top-level
  field in the schema. Returns an error if any row's scalar count doesn't match the schema's
  field count, or if a scalar value's type doesn't match its corresponding field.

### Default implementation

The `DefaultEngine` uses Arrow compute kernels for expression evaluation.
